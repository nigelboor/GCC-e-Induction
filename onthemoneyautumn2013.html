There are a number of reasons for this, appeals and successful payments of Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) and also a number of tenancy terminations.<br/>•     Average reduction in Housing Benefit is now £13.72 per week per affected tenancy.<br/>This further breaks down to:</p><p class="s19">         <span class="p">£12.12 per week – 1 bed under-occupied (1177 tenancies)</span></p><p class="s19">         <span class="p">£21.87 per week – 2 bed+ under-occupied (245 tenancies)</span></p><p>•     This now equates to a potential £20,375 per week drop in income direct to us, a slight decrease on the September figure of £20,445.<br/>•     Potential annual arrears increase therefore is £1,059,500.<br/>•     Our analysis of the figures shows that of 1,387 tenants, 770 cases have seen an increase in their arrears since under occupancy deductions came into effect. The potential annual arrears impact of this is now £336,548.</p><p class="s20">3                                            <span class="s21">keeping you on top of welfare reform</span></p><p><span><IMG width="795" height="1116" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_009.png"/></span></p><p class="s11">on<span style=" color: #941392;">the</span><span style=" color: #000;">money </span>autumn 2013</p><p class="s18">Mitigating the impact - what are we doing?</p><p>We are very concerned about the impact benefits cuts have on our tenants and the knock-on effect this could have on the business.

We work in 35 Local Authority areas and so we are concerned that we do not yet know when each area will be moved over onto UC.<br/>•     We are assessing the ‘vulnerability’ category under UC and looking at ways to exempt and support these tenants. There remains uncertainty and a lack of clarity by Government in this area. Vulnerability can for example be those who are not financially dependent, those with debt problems and poor credit histories, as well as those with physical and mental disabilities or literacy issues.<br/>•     We are working with our care and support arm Enable, to assess the accommodation we have and look at any that can be classified as exempt within the meaning of the UC regulations.</p><p class="s25">Discretionary Housing Payments</p><p>•     Discussions with Local Authority colleagues lead us to believe that there<br/>is still financial support available in the Discretionary Housing Payment funds. We continue to encourage tenants to appeal decisions on under occupancy but we have started dialogue with Local Authorities about them using this to support tenants to downsize, for example by providing removal costs funding.</p><p class="s25">Under-25s removal of Housing Benefit</p><p>•     We have begun to model the impact of this possible policy change. Early indications show that housing benefit income of £1.6M is attributable to this client group. We need to ensure that if this policy change is enacted, we have measures in place to address any income reduction as a result.</p><p class="s21">keeping you on top of welfare reform                                       <span class="s30">6</span></p><p><span><IMG width="795" height="1116" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p class="s11">on<span style=" color: #941392;">the</span><span style=" color: #000;">money </span>autumn 2013</p><p class="s18">Our Future Initiatives</p><p>We know that the impact on our tenants and the business will continue as the roll out of Universal Credit and other changes to welfare reform ensue, and so we want to ensure we are best placed to support our tenants and to bring in the income. We are planning a number of initiatives to achieve this objective including:<br/>•     Ensuring that ‘every contact counts’. We want to ensure we use every opportunity to talk to tenants about the changes and to capture information on their circumstances, profile and impact. This includes the role our contractors and in-house maintenance teams can play. Our aim is to use this exercise to target resources and better inform the business approaches to be taken;<br/>•     Assessing the outcomes working with Experian on the ‘Rental Exchange’<br/>project can bring to us and our customers;<br/>•     Utilising a community insight tool to provide more intelligence to inform future plans and targeting of support, products and advice;<br/>•     Setting up the new Income Team and developing targets, ways of working and lead in plans.</p><p class="s31">7                                            <span class="s21">keeping you on top of welfare reform</span></p><p><span><IMG width="782" height="1116" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_013.png"/></span></p><p class="s11">on<span style=" color: #941392;">the</span><span style=" color: #000;">money </span>autumn 2013</p><p class="s32">Moore for your Money</p><h2>emh homes housing teams are getting extra support across the region from five new Welfare Reform Officers. We recently met with Adrian Moore, based at our Leicester Office to find out what he has been up to and what the impact has been. He told us:</h2><p class="s16">‘I am here to provide support to the team by focusing in on particular cases and carry out</p><p class="s16">in- depth income and expenditure work with those tenants. The aim is to maximise the income and then ensure that there is clear agreement in place to pay rent and any arrears as a result.</p><p class="s16">‘The big question is whether or not they can actually pay the rent in the first place. Often there are very simple solutions. For instance one tenant did not realise that he didn’t have to pay for Council Tax in February or March. This led to a negotiated agreement to pay the majority of this ‘saved’ money into his rent account.</p><p class="s16">‘We also managed to help another tenant who was paying</p><p class="s16">£20.00 per month in contents insurance to find a massive saving. He is now paying £5.65 per month and is able to manage his money and his rent payments much more easily. It is early days and I have just begun to scratch the</p><p class="s16">surface, but am confident that there will be many more</p><p class="s16">stories like these two!’</p><p class="s17">keeping you on top of welfare reform                                     <span class="s14">8</span></p><p><span><IMG width="246" height="111" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_014.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="282" height="134" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_015.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s33">FOR</p><p><span><IMG width="33" height="78" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_016.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="77" height="180" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_017.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="126" height="57" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_018.png"/></span></p><p class="s34">BENEFIT</p><p><span><IMG width="364" height="68" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_019.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="1" height="408" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_020.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="434" height="571" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_021.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="333" height="158" src="onthemoneyautumn2013/Image_022.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s35">keeping you on top of welfare reform</p></body></html>
